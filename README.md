evolution makes microbes more cooperative with their local host
genotype.

### Abstract

Advances in microbiome science require a better understanding of how
beneficial microbes adapt to hosts. We tested if hosts select for more
cooperative microbial strains with a year-long evolution experiment and
a cross-inoculation experiment designed to explore how nitrogen-fixing
bacteria (rhizobia) adapt to legumes. We paired *Ensifer meliloti* with
one of five *Medicago truncatula* genotypes that vary in how strongly
they ‘choose’ bacterial symbionts. Independent of host choice, *Ensifer
meliloti* rapidly adapted to its local host genotype and derived
microbes were more beneficial when they shared evolutionary history with
their host. This local adaptation was mostly limited to the symbiosis
plasmids, with mutations in putative signalling genes. Thus, cooperation
depends on the match between partner genotypes and increases as bacteria
adapt to their local host.
